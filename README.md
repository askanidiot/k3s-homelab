## What?

This project serves as a code repository, documentation store, and scratchpad for moving some self-hosted workloads from a Proxmox box over to a k3s cluster.

## Where are we now?

We're at the very beginning, and at the forefront is:

1. Scoping requirements.

## Why?

I could sing the virtues of resilience and ease of recovery, but that would be lying. The truth would sound more like this:

1. its cool (nerd),
2. its fun (nerd),
3. its good practice (chronic nerd),
4. I have time (unemployed).
