# k3s-homelab

## ü§î What?

This project serves as a code repository, documentation store, and scratchpad for moving some self-hosted workloads from a Proxmox box over to a k3s cluster - while scoping in some new services.

## ü§° Why?

I could sing the virtues of resilience and ease of recovery, but that would be lying. The truth is more like this:

1. Its cool (nerd).
2. Its fun (nerd).
3. Its good practice (nerd).
4. I have time (unemployed).

## üó∫Ô∏è Where are we now?

I'm at the very beginning. Front of mind are:

1. Spilling the weeks of thoughts I've had into documentation.
2. Endlessly restructuring from a single readme to multiple files, and vice versa.
3. With a clear specification, laying out a potential roadmap.
